# eslint-config-team23-ngrx

A set of eslint rules used by TEAM23 for angular projects using NgRx

## Installation in your project
Add the library to your `package.json` as `devDependency`

```bash
npm i --save-dev @team23/eslint-config-team23-ngrx
```

### Usage in your project

If you've enabled `eslint` locally within your project, just set your `.eslintrc.[json|js]` config to extend the rules from this repo:

#### Extend Globally
```json
{
    "extends": "@team23/eslint-config-team23-ngrx"
}
```

#### Extend overrides
```json
{
    "overrides": [
        {
            "files": [
                "*.ts",
                "*.tsx"
            ],
            "extends": [
                "@team23/eslint-config-team23-ngrx"
            ],
            "rules": {}
        },
    ]
}
```

### Extending the .eslintrc.json

Simply add a `"rules"` key to your config, then add your overrides and additions there.

```json
{
    "extends": "@team23/eslint-config-team23-ngrx"
    "rules": {
        "@ngrx/avoid-mapping-selectors": "off",
    }
}
```
